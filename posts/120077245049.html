<blockquote abp="3952"><p abp="3953">Vintage in terms of material and almost in age (this was published in 1993, while the first edition was from 1991 – all before Windows 95 came out and made using command-line MS-DOS and its alternatives outdated), here we have the Dummies series book <i abp="3954">DOS For Dummies, 2nd edition.</i></p><p abp="3955">Written by one of the Dummies’ series authors and computing legend prior to that, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Gookin" abp="3956">Dan Gookin</a>, it’s a fun read and will teach you a few things you can still use under Windows 10 – what to type in the Run line or CMD window to accomplsih things manually, some of which you can’t do effectively in Windows… for example, a batch filetype change (REN *.GIF *.JPG).</p>
<p abp="3957">I included the page with the differences between / and \ because to this day I still hear people get the two confused when giving URLs.</p></blockquote>

<p abp="3958">There is one version floating around (3rd, I believe) that I have a copy of that shows you how to use DOS as well as Windows 95 and 98. It&rsquo;s very much a glimpse into a lost world.</p>
